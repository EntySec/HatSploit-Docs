The key question many ask is: **How do you start working with HatSploit?** This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how to begin using the HatSploit Framework effectively.

## Initial launch

To get started with HatSploit, the first step is to launch the framework. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
hsf
```

Once this command is run, you will be prompted with a message to accept the terms of service. You need to confirm your agreement to proceed further.

```entysec
[?] Accept HatSploit Framework Terms of Service? [y/n]
```

After accepting the terms, HatSploit will ask whether you'd like to build and connect its base databases. This process involves loading all the frameworkâ€™s essential modules, plugins, and payloads, and saving them to the database for faster access.

```entysec
[?] Do you want to build and connect base databases? [y/n]
```

Once these initial setup steps are completed, the main HatSploit interface will be presented:

```entysec
                     ___________
                    < HatSploit >
                     -----------
                .''    /
      ._.-.___.' (`\  /
     //(        ( `'
    '/ )\ ).__. )
    ' <' `\ ._/'       `   \     
    --=[ HatSploit Framework 3.0.0 unfulf1ll3d (https://hatsploit.com)
--==--=[ Developed by EntySec (https://entysec.com)
    --=[ 55 modules | 60 payloads | 2 encoders | 3 plugins

HatSploit Tip: You can run a module in the background by using `run -j`.

## Executing commands

HatSploit offers a variety of commands that allow you to interact with its functionality. To see a list of all available commands, you can simply type `help` or `?`. This will provide you with a list of commands alongside a description of their purpose.

```
Core Commands:

    Command    Description
    clear      Clear terminal window.
    exit       Exit console.
    help       Show all available commands.
    quit       Exit console.
    exit       Exit HatSploit Framework.
```

Each command is designed to assist you in navigating through the framework's features with ease. Familiarizing yourself with these commands will significantly enhance your user experience.

## Startup options

HatSploit provides several run options that can be selected via command-line arguments at startup. These options allow you to customize the execution of the framework according to your needs.

```
usage: hsf [-h] [-c] [--check-modules] [--check-payloads] [--check-encoders]
           [--check-plugins] [--rpc] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [-u]
           [-s SCRIPT] [--no-exit] [--no-startup]

Modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and
execute exploit code.

Options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -c, --check           Check base modules, payloads, encoders, and plugins.
  --check-modules       Check only base modules.
  --check-payloads      Check only base payloads.
  --check-encoders      Check only base encoders.
  --check-plugins       Check only base plugins.
  --rpc                 Start HatSploit RPC server.
  --host HOST           Specify HatSploit RPC server host. [Default: 127.0.0.1]
  --port PORT           Specify HatSploit RPC server port. [Default: 5000]
  -u, --update          Update HatSploit Framework.
  -s SCRIPT, --script SCRIPT
                        Execute HatSploit commands from a script file.
  --no-exit             Do not exit after script execution.
  --no-startup          Do not execute the startup.hsf file on startup.
```

These command-line options provide a more advanced and flexible way to interact with HatSploit, especially when automating tasks or managing multiple instances.

## HatSploit startup file

The HatSploit startup file is a crucial feature for automating repetitive tasks. It contains all the commands that should be executed automatically on startup. This file is stored in the HatSploit workspace at:

```
~/.hsf/startup.hsf
```

By configuring this file, you can streamline your workflow by predefining certain actions to be executed every time HatSploit is launched.

## About payloads

HatSploit payloads are sent to the target after successful exploitation of vulnerability by module.

They can differ, from platform and style to architecture and execution.

## Using payloads

To use a specific payload, you should first select the module that supports payload execution.

Let's take `exploit/linux/generic/32764_code_execution` module that exploits the built-in backdoor in several routers and attempts to gain code execution.
